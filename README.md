# ðŸ§  Gen-AI: Exploring Generative AI with LangChain and OpenAI

Welcome to the **Gen-AI** repository! This project is a hands-on exploration of **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and **agentic architectures** using tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. The goal is to build intelligent, context-aware systems capable of conversational reasoning, knowledge extraction, and task execution.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

- Build RAG pipelines using LangChain + FAISS
- Integrate OpenAI APIs for intelligent text generation
- Prototype multi-step agents with LangChain agents
- Explore prompt engineering and LLM evaluation
- Design domain-specific workflows for analytics and content tasks

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **LangChain**  
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 APIs**  
- **FAISS** (for vector search)  
- **Streamlit** (for UI components)  
- **PyPDF2 / LangChain document loaders**  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for experimentation and EDA)
